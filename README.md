# PHP File Manager System With Login Functionality



A redesign of https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager with the ability to use a sql database to login. It's not a one-page version anymore though, as there are new pages to manage your account, logout, register, login, and a db config file for sql. I have linked a sql zip file to automatically set up the required database tables for this PHP system to work in this repo as well.



I will release docs later on how to set up the db and site if you're not able to figure it out yourself. If you already have experience with backend PHP, and web development, it shouldn't be hard to set this up.



List of changes that have been made:



- Permanent dark mode (redesigned the dark mode to look more modern and better styled, also light mode is disabled)



- Added SQL Functionality to revamp the auth system for more security.



- Added a way to manage your account when using the file manager (email and reset password)



## Other info



I would recommend only using the file manager for personal use or for web hosting panels. But not to share access.
